<p>I used to hate shaving. I ranked it below flossing on my list of bathroom-related activities that I would dread. Of course, no one knew if I skipped flossing; everyone can tell if I skipped a shave.</p>

<p>My father taught me to shave using an electric Norelco razor, an approach I stuck with for years. My biggest problem with the Norelco electric razor was that it left me with a crappy shave. It was quick enough, but I never looked truly clean shaven.</p>

<p>In college, a friend introduced me to <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=acoustic%20shave">acoustic shaving</a> with more traditional, disposable razors. Over the years, I kept up with the blade arms race, switching from two to three to four to five-blade razors over time, some with batteries that made them vibrate, some with lubricating strips, some with built in trimmers on the flip side.</p>

<p>I didn’t like the disposable razors much, either, but I stuck with them for years. The shaves were still fairly mediocre at best, shaving the moustache region never felt great, and I found over time that the blades seemed to get crappier: I’d need to chuck newer replacement blades ever more quickly.</p>

<p>Finally, I got fed up with shaves and razors of frustrating quality, and I made a change. It’s a change that saves me money, gets me a dramatically better shave, and converted me from a begrudging shaver who hated the morning shave into a guy who looks forward to it as a highlight of the morning ritual.</p>
