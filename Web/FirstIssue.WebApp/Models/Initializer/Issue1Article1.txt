<p>There was a time you’d pay good money for a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/members/info">Linked List</a>, but these days it’s <em>de rigueur</em> for smaller, independent sites. Ten years into Daring Fireball (though only six into the Linked List) and you’ll find Apple commentary most often in the form of a link, a pull quote and a brief remark.</p>

<p>This article has been in my hopper for ages, long before I realized that Daring Fireball was turning ten this year, and before Marco approached me with an offer to write for his new project. I’d been noticing the shift in the way commentary was being approached and had jotted down some notes, some notions and a fair bit of nonsense. Marco’s New Thing seemed like a good reason to actually put my nose to the grindstone and get something written. Working glacially, as I often do with writing, turned out to be serendipitous. There was a brief <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/08/09/linkblogs">flurry</a> <a href="http://tightwind.net/2012/08/somers-linkblogging/">of</a> <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/08/09/linkblog-cancer/">introspection</a> triggered by this piece by Marcelo Somers: <a href="http://behindcompanies.com/2012/08/the-linkblog-cancer/">The Linkblog Cancer</a>.</p>

<p>Despite all the discussion surrounding a topic that had been nagging away at me, I didn’t really find anything said about what had been on my mind. It’s not just “Linkblogs” that have become popular: it’s the Fireball Format. It’s not simply a matter of finding a link, pulling a quote, and coming up with a quip — the way that the Fireball Format brings in money has also been adopted.</p>

<p>It’s relatively easy to see why the Linkblog portion of the Fireball Format has become popular. It’s deceptively easy to link to articles of interest, and it offers the author a voice in the conversation without them having to invest in writing a longer piece. In this format, it’s the voice that starts to become of paramount importance. The voice isn’t just the jokes and commentary, it’s the editorial stewardship of the links that are shared. A Linkblog is, fundamentally, a personality-driven endeavour.</p>
